//i didnt find it so So I found how to keep a cascading style code in files and then how to import it from that file to a main code. That was, I guess, real helpful, though I don't, I'm not sure that I would be able to use it, coz I'm not going inside css. I might know that how to get it done But, yeah, that only because the person who was teaching me, I was teaching this one how to style up, how to navigate bar and all that. So I change the colour font and background colour, then margin and other stuffs. So you can say, I did a great I did a some good work, but it was not that helpful to me And I will keep going to put some ceases and html code, which I wrote. I'm going to just put a single app .js file, or I will just put the that thing with what is same I will try to put what I can So
js code

app.use((req, res, next) => {
    res.status(404).sendFile(path.join(__dirname,'routes', 'views', 'error.html'));
});


html code

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Add-Product</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/main.css">
    
</head>
<body>
   <header class="main-header">
    <nav class="main-header_nav">
        <ul class="main-header_item-list">
            <li class="main-header_item"><a class="active" href="/">Shop</a></li>
            <li class="main-header_item"><a class="active" href="/add-product">Add Product</a></li>
        </ul>
